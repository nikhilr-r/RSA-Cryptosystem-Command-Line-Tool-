<b>RSA Cryptosystem Command-Line Tool <b>
A pure Java implementation of the RSA public-key cryptosystem. This command-line tool provides functionality to generate RSA key pairs, encrypt files using a public key, and decrypt them using the corresponding private key.

This project was developed as a practical application of the concepts learned in a Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) course, focusing on number theory, algorithm efficiency, and file handling.
